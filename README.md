This repository is dedicated to providing materials for the "Deep Learning and applications" 2022 Summer School from IRMIA++.

Session on Deep Learning for object detection: focus on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) detector.

Post-School update: this repository has been updated to correct some errors and provide better pre-trained networks
- The pre-trained networks save files are now light enough to be hosted on the git
- Training is now performed on (PASCAL) Train 2007 and Train 2012, and validation/test is done on Test 2007
- Switch to a newer version of CIANNA that corrects several aspects of the YOLO layer
- Update of the slides to reflect the previous changes
